# Food Order Management System

If you are having trouble running the program normally in Qt Creator using the
`food-order-management-system-refactored.pro`, you can copy and paste the contents of the `aio.cpp` file into an online
compiler.

Sometimes on the school computers, if the build process is hanging, you can make a trivial edit to the .pro file, revert it, and restart the build process for it to go through.
